What makes a game successful?

In this project I'll take a role of the online store employee "Ice", which sells videogames all over the world. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources. We need to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This allows you to put your money on a potentially hot new item and plan advertising campaigns.

In front of us is data going back to 2016. Let’s imagine that it’s December 2016 and we’re planning a campaign for 2017.

The data set contains the abbreviation ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board). The ESRB evaluates a game's content and assigns an appropriate age categories, such as Teen and Mature.
